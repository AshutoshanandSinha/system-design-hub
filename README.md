## Overview

System Design Hub is a carefully curated collection of system design concepts, patterns, case studies, and resources designed to help engineers at all levels master the art of building scalable, reliable, and efficient distributed systems.

## What's Inside?

### For Junior Engineers (0-3 years)
- Fundamental concepts and building blocks
- Basic architecture patterns
- Core infrastructure components
- Simple system design exercises

### For Mid-Level Engineers (3-5 years)
- Advanced patterns and trade-offs
- Database design and scaling strategies
- Microservices architecture
- Real-world case studies

### For Senior Engineers (5-8 years)
- Distributed systems deep dive
- Complex system trade-offs
- Performance optimization at scale
- Architecture decision-making frameworks

### For Staff+ and Distinguished Engineers (8+ years)
- Multi-region architectures
- Chaos engineering and resilience
- Cost optimization at scale
- Organizational system design patterns
