## Overview

System design interviews evaluate your ability to design large-scale systems, make trade-offs, and communicate technical decisions effectively. This section provides structured preparation guidance for engineers at all levels.

## Interview Format

### Typical Interview Structure (45-60 minutes)

| Phase | Time | Activity |
|:------|:-----|:---------|
| **Requirements Gathering** | 5-10 min | Clarify scope, constraints, assumptions |
| **High-Level Design** | 10-15 min | Draw architecture, identify components |
| **Deep Dive** | 15-20 min | Dive into 2-3 key components |
| **Trade-offs & Bottlenecks** | 10-15 min | Discuss alternatives, scaling, failures |

## The RADIO Framework

Use this framework to structure your approach:

### R - Requirements Clarification

**Functional Requirements**:
- What features are needed?
- What are the core use cases?
- What are the inputs and outputs?

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- Scale (users, requests, data)
- Performance (latency, throughput)
- Availability (SLA targets)
- Consistency needs

**Example Questions**:
```
- How many daily active users?
- What's the read/write ratio?
- What's the expected latency?
- What's the data size?
- Any specific compliance requirements?
```

### A - API Design

Define the interface:

```
// Example: URL Shortener
POST   /api/v1/shorten
  Request: { "long_url": "https://..." }
  Response: { "short_url": "https://short.ly/abc123" }

GET    /api/v1/:short_code
  Redirects to original URL

GET    /api/v1/analytics/:short_code
  Returns click statistics
```

### D - Data Model

Design your schema:

```sql
-- Example: URL Shortener
CREATE TABLE urls (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  short_code VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  original_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  user_id BIGINT,
  click_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE INDEX idx_short_code ON urls(short_code);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON urls(user_id);
```

### I - Implementation (High-Level Design)

Draw the architecture:

```
Client → Load Balancer → API Servers → Cache → Database
                                ↓
                          Analytics Queue → Analytics DB
```

### O - Optimize & Dive Deep

Discuss:
- Bottlenecks
- Scaling strategies
- Failure scenarios
- Trade-offs

## Example Solution Walkthrough

### Design Twitter (45 min)

#### Phase 1: Requirements (7 min)

**Functional**:
- Post tweets (280 chars)
- Follow users
- View timeline (home + user)
- Like and retweet

**Non-Functional**:
- 500M daily active users
- 200M tweets per day
- Read-heavy (100:1 read/write ratio)
- Timeline latency < 200ms
- High availability (99.99%)

**Scale**:
- 200M tweets/day = 2,300 tweets/sec
- 200,000 reads/sec for timeline
- 5 years of data = 365B tweets

#### Phase 2: API Design (3 min)

```
POST   /api/v1/tweets
GET    /api/v1/timeline/home
GET    /api/v1/timeline/user/:user_id
POST   /api/v1/follow/:user_id
POST   /api/v1/like/:tweet_id
```

#### Phase 3: Data Model (5 min)

```sql
users (id, username, created_at)
tweets (id, user_id, content, created_at)
follows (follower_id, followee_id, created_at)
likes (user_id, tweet_id, created_at)
```

#### Phase 4: High-Level Design (15 min)

```
Write Path:
Client → Load Balancer → API Server → Tweet Service
                              ↓
                         Message Queue → Fan-out Service → Cache
                              ↓
                         Tweet DB

Read Path:
Client → Load Balancer → API Server → Timeline Service
                              ↓
                         Redis Cache (Timeline) → Tweet DB
```

#### Phase 5: Deep Dive (15 min)

**Timeline Generation**:

Option 1: Fan-out on Write (Push)
```
When user tweets:
- Find all followers
- Write tweet to each follower's timeline cache
- Pros: Fast reads
- Cons: Slow writes for celebrities
```

Option 2: Fan-out on Read (Pull)
```
When user requests timeline:
- Find all following users
- Fetch their recent tweets
- Merge and sort
- Pros: Fast writes
- Cons: Slow reads
```

Option 3: Hybrid
```
- Push for regular users (< 10K followers)
- Pull for celebrities (> 10K followers)
- Best of both worlds
```

**Data Sharding**:
- Shard by user_id for tweets and follows
- Shard by timeline owner for timeline cache
- Use consistent hashing

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Jumping to Solution Too Quickly
{: .text-red-200}

**Don't**: Start drawing architecture immediately

**Do**: Spend 5-10 minutes clarifying requirements

### 2. Ignoring Scale
{: .text-red-200}

**Don't**: Design for 1000 users when problem requires millions

**Do**: Calculate rough numbers and design for scale

### 3. Over-Engineering
{: .text-red-200}

**Don't**: Use every technology you know

**Do**: Start simple, add complexity when justified

### 4. Poor Communication
{: .text-red-200}

**Don't**: Work silently or speak unclearly

**Do**: Think out loud, explain your reasoning

### 5. Ignoring Trade-offs
{: .text-red-200}

**Don't**: Present only one solution

**Do**: Discuss alternatives and trade-offs
