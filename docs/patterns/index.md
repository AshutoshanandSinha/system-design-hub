## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Distributed Monolith
{: .text-red-200}

**Problem**: Microservices that are tightly coupled and must deploy together.

**Symptoms**:
- Shared databases across services
- Synchronous calls for every operation
- Cannot deploy services independently

**Solution**:
- Proper service boundaries
- Async communication
- Database per service

### 2. Premature Optimization
{: .text-red-200}

**Problem**: Over-engineering before understanding actual needs.

**Symptoms**:
- Complex architecture for simple problems
- Using cutting-edge tech without justification
- Optimizing before measuring

**Solution**:
- Start simple, evolve based on needs
- Measure before optimizing
- Use boring technology

### 3. Data Duplication Hell
{: .text-red-200}

**Problem**: Too much data duplication without proper synchronization.

**Symptoms**:
- Same data in multiple databases
- Inconsistency across services
- No source of truth

**Solution**:
- Define data ownership
- Use event sourcing or CDC
- Implement eventual consistency properly

### 4. Chatty Microservices
{: .text-red-200}

**Problem**: Too many synchronous calls between services.

**Symptoms**:
- High latency
- Cascading failures
- Network congestion

**Solution**:
- Batch requests
- Use async messaging
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Consider service boundaries

## Trade-offs Summary

| Pattern | Pros | Cons | Complexity |
|:--------|:-----|:-----|:-----------|
| **Microservices** | Scalability, independence | Distributed complexity | High |
| **Monolith** | Simplicity, easy to develop | Limited scalability | Low |
| **Event-Driven** | Loose coupling, scalability | Eventual consistency | Medium |
| **CQRS** | Optimized reads/writes | Two models to maintain | High |
| **Saga** | Distributed transactions | Complex error handling | High |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Fault isolation | Additional latency | Medium |

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple

{: .highlight }
Begin with the simplest architecture that meets your needs. Add complexity only when required and justified by data.

### 2. Design for Failure

Assume every component will fail. Build resilience through:
- Timeouts
- Retries
- Circuit breakers
- Graceful degradation

### 3. Optimize for Observability

Make your system observable from day one:
- Structured logging
- Distributed tracing
- Metrics and dashboards
- Alerting

### 4. Document Decisions

Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document:
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences
- Alternatives considered

### 5. Measure Everything

{: .important }
"If you can't measure it, you can't improve it." - Peter Drucker

Track:
- Latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates
- Request rates
- Resource utilization

## Interview Preparation

### Common Questions

**Q: "When would you use microservices vs monolith?"**

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Use Monolith when**:
- Small team (< 10 developers)
- Simple domain
- Rapid prototyping/MVP
- Limited operational expertise
- Low traffic

**Use Microservices when**:
- Large team (multiple teams)
- Complex domain with clear boundaries
- Need independent scaling
- Different technology requirements per service
- High traffic with varied load patterns

**Real-world**: Most companies start with monolith and evolve to microservices as they grow. Don't start with microservices unless you have a clear need.

</details>

**Q: "How do you handle distributed transactions in microservices?"**

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Options**:

1. **Saga Pattern** (Recommended)
   - Choreography: Event-based coordination
   - Orchestration: Central coordinator
   - Compensating transactions for rollback

2. **Two-Phase Commit**
   - Coordinator + participants
   - All or nothing
   - High latency, not recommended for microservices

3. **Eventual Consistency**
   - Accept temporary inconsistency
   - Eventually consistent through events
   - Best for many use cases

**Real-world**: Saga pattern is most common. Example: Order → Payment → Inventory, with compensation if payment fails.
