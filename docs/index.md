## What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It's a crucial skill for engineers at all levels, from understanding basic concepts to architecting complex distributed systems that serve billions of users.

## Why This Hub?

In today's technology landscape, being a talented coder isn't enough. You need to be an engineer who can:

- **Architect scalable systems** that handle growth gracefully
- **Make informed trade-offs** between consistency, availability, and performance
- **Design for reliability** and fault tolerance
- **Optimize for cost** at scale
- **Communicate technical decisions** effectively

This hub consolidates the best resources, concepts, and practices to help you master these skills.

## 📚 Learning Paths by Experience Level
