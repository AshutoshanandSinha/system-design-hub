## What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It's a crucial skill for engineers at all levels, from understanding basic concepts to architecting complex distributed systems that serve billions of users.

## Why This Hub?

In today's technology landscape, being a talented coder isn't enough. You need to be an engineer who can:

- **Architect scalable systems** that handle growth gracefully
- **Make informed trade-offs** between consistency, availability, and performance
- **Design for reliability** and fault tolerance
- **Optimize for cost** at scale
- **Communicate technical decisions** effectively

This hub consolidates the best resources, concepts, and practices to help you master these skills.

## Learning Paths by Experience Level

### Junior Engineers (0-3 years)
{: .text-green-200}

Start here if you're new to system design or have limited experience with distributed systems.

**Focus Areas:**
- Fundamental concepts (scalability, latency, throughput)
- Basic infrastructure components (servers, databases, caches)
- Simple architecture patterns
- HTTP, REST APIs, and basic networking
